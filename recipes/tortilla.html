    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef.
      Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and
      garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in
      sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4
      cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce,
      and chicken broth. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and
      simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles
      into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles,
      making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak
      for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water. In a mixing bowl, combine
      ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon
      salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.To assemble,
      spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place
      4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with
      1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over
      mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering
      two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final
      layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the
      pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely
      with aluminum foil.Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and
      bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.
